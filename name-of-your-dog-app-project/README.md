## Overview

## Set Up

1. In your labs folder, create a new react app using `npx create-react-app name-of-your-dog-app-project`
2. cd into your newly created project folder
3. Use `code .` to open the app in VS Code
4. `npm run start` to start the dev server
5. Install any packages we might need (i.e.`npm install axios`. Remember to import them where appropriate in your app)
6. Also create a `components/` directory
7. Submit your lab/hw link as a issue ticket


## Fetching Dogs

- Let's first create a function inside of `App.js` that will make an axios get request to the dog api and return a list of dog breeds.
>HINT: Refer to the [dog api docs](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to find the correct endpoint to hit.
- Also keep in mind how we are going to parse the data. This api might throw you a curve ball.
- We can test our new function by putting it in `componentDidMount()`. 
>Note: we only need componentDidMount for testing. We wont be using it in our final app.


- Let's create a new component called `BreedList.js`. This component will have a button and will take a list of breeds, and map them onto the screen.
>Note: In order to render the data from the list, we'll need to pass that data from the state of `App.js` to the `BreedList` component through props.
- The button will need an `onClick` function. Use our api method from `App.js` as that function passed down through props.
- In `App.js`, import our `BreedList.js` component and render it to the DOM. When we are calling it, we should pass the dog breeds through props from state and also our api method.

## Random Dog Pix

- For the random pog pictures, let's start by making another function that makes another axios get request in `App.js`. This function needs to take a parameter for the dog breed. We can interpolate that parameter into the url string for our endpoint. You can now set the response in state.

- Make a new component called `RandomDogs.js`.
- We can build out a simple form with one input and a button. The input will need a `handleChange` function passed to it through props.

- For the onSubmit function of the form, we can use our api function from `App.js` that grabs the random dog pic. We will need to pass it a argument. **That means that we need to nest it inside of an anonymous arrow function.** Remember that the arrow function needs to handle the preventDefault on the event instead of the api method.
- This component should also render an image tag underneath the form. This image tag should render conditionally if there is a dog pic in props. Use the "and" `&&` operator to achieve this.
- Now import the `RandomDogs.js` component in `App.js`. Inside `render()`, place `RandomDogs.js` with `BreedList.js`. We should only be passing our random dogs api method and the dog pic from state through props.

## Conditionally Switching Views

Now we need a way of conditionally switching between our two components. 

- In `App.js`, let's add a value in state called `currentView`.
- We need to make a method called `setView` that will take a string of text and setState to `currentView` with the string parameter.
- Now lets make another method called `pageView`. This method will have a switch statement. We can use `currentView` from state for our condition. Our cases for the switch statement should return our `RandomDogs` component if the `currentView` is "random dogs" or return `BreedList` component as a default case.
- Don't forget to pass down the appropriate objects through props to each component.
- Inside our `render()`, replace `RandomDogs.js` with a line that calls `{this.pageView()}`
- This should conditionally render our default case from our switch statement now. But we want a way of changing the view.
- Lets make a `Header.js` component that has our "My Dog Website" title and two links. 
>Hint: don't use `<a>` tags. Use something like a `<span>` or `<li>` and just make them look like links.
- On our links, add onClick functions. These will be anonymous arrow functions again. We can then call our `setView` method from `App.js` inside of these onClick functions. Pass the value 'random dogs' to one of the `setView` functions. The other `setView` can take 'dog breeds' (or anything really. it's our default case)
- Import `Header.js` into `App.js` and call it inside our render above our `{this.pageView()}`. Don't forget to pass `setView` through props.
